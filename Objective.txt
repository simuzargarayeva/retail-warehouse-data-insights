📦 Retail & Warehouse Sales Analysis using SQL (Oracle)

This project analyzes a retail and warehouse sales dataset using SQL (Oracle syntax). I explored key business metrics by solving multiple business-oriented SQL problems related to product performance, supplier efficiency, sales trends, and contribution analysis (Pareto). The project simulates real-world use cases commonly seen in retail analytics and supply chain management.

📁 Dataset Fields

Includes fields such as:

year, month, supplier, item_code, item_name, item_type, retail_sales, retail_transfers, warehouse_sales


✅ Business Questions Answered

1. Top 5 best-selling products by retail sales
2. Average monthly retail sales by supplier
3. Monthly trend analysis of warehouse sales
4. Products with the highest difference between retail and warehouse sales
5. Identify whether retail or warehouse sales dominate per product
6. Find peak retail sales month per product
7. List distinct products sold by the top 3 suppliers by total retail sales
8. Pareto analysis: Which products contribute to 80% of total retail sales


🔧 SQL Concepts Used

Filtering: WHERE, HAVING
Aggregation: SUM, AVG, ABS
Grouping and Sorting: GROUP BY, ORDER BY
Conditional Logic: CASE WHEN
Ranking & Trends: ROW_NUMBER(), OVER(PARTITION BY ...)
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): for subquery organization and Pareto analysis
Cumulative Calculations: SUM(...) OVER() to compute running totals



📊 Key Insights

A few top-selling products drive most of the retail revenue (Pareto principle observed)
Some products show high discrepancies between warehouse and retail sales, indicating possible inventory or distribution issues
Monthly and supplier-based sales trends help in understanding seasonality and supplier performance
Identifying dominant sales channels (retail vs warehouse) enables better demand planning
Knowing the peak month for each product supports time-based marketing and stocking strategies
